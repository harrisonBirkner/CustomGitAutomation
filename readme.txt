!!REQUIREMENTS BEFORE RUNNING!!
- Chromedriver.exe is required on the C drive
- A .env file is required in the directory, with USERNAME(github username), PASSWORD(github password), and FILEPATH(absolute filepath to directory you want repos created in) variables.

The following syntax rules apply to the .env file:
- Each line in an env file should be in VARIABLE=VALUE format.
- Lines beginning with # are processed as comments and ignored.
- Blank lines are ignored.
- There is no special handling of quotation marks. This means that they are part of the VALUE.
